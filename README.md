## Know My Stats
This is an individual project for the [BCIT Winter Hacks 2021](https://bcit-winter-hacks-2021.devpost.com/).

## Inspiration
At the end of the year, YouTube would announce the list of top trending videos and channels in different countries.  While platforms like Spotify have native features to summarise activity data for users, so far YouTube has no features that help users to know the videos and channels mostly watched by themselves over the past year.

## What it does
*Know My Stats* is a data visualization tool that helps users better understand their watch histories on YouTube.

## How we built it
*Know My Stats* is built with the React framework, along with libraries including Bootstrap 5, Redux and Chart.js.

## Challenges we ran into
Due to YouTube's policy, YouTube does not provide any open APIs regarding users' watch history.  As such, users have to to manually download the JSON data from YouTube before using *Know My Stats*.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
*Know My Stats* has accomplished the develop the data visualization feature that is not provided natively on the YouTube platform.  

## What we learned
We learnt how to use the React framework and the library of Redux.  We also learnt how to use the Bootstrap and Chart.js libraries in React.

## What's next for Know My Stats
Due to time constraint, the project has not been hosted.  The next for *Know My Stats* would be hosting the website using Docker and the AWS services.
